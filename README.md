# Server Check Python
A basic python script to check if the server is working or not and send mail in case its not working.

# IMPORTANT NOTES
# MAKE SURE GMAIL CAN SEND MAIL USING SMTP PORT
# if you want to automotically check you can add a cron job by using command crontab -e for ubuntu/mac users
# * * * * * python /home/ubuntu/server_check.py >> /home/ubuntu/crons.txt
# This will automatically build log after every one interval
